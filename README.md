# Object-Recognition-using-OpenCV-Python
One of the important subsets of Artificial Intelligence is Computer Vision. Computer Vision is the science of computers and software systems that can recognize and understand images and scenes. Computer Vision is also composed of various aspects such as image recognition, object detection, image generation, image super-resolution and more. Object detection is probably the most profound aspect of computer vision due the number practical use cases.
I have built an object recognition tool using OpenCV-Python. The tool is simple and has high accuracy in detecting a wide range of objects.

# Details
-Programming Language: Python

-Library: OpenCV

-Mobilenet-ssd model is used for this project as it has a good balance between accuracy and speed. 

-It is trained with COCO Dataset and can identify around 100 common objects.

# Images

Input:

The objects are identified and highlighted using boxes. The name and the percentage of certainty are displayed.
